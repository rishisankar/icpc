idea: 2d segtree

nxn grid, you start at (x,y), you can go manhattan distance of k away at each time step
a bunch of portals are appearing at certain times with certain point values, take you from (x,y)->(x',y')
each time step, you jump in the portal with max score, assuming one exists (else do nothing)
what total score will you get

solution:
- 2d segtree rotated 45 degrees



harder version: treap/bbst on 2d segtree

- each portal accepts a specific score range

sadge 3d gross (1d version 2 easy)
