suppose u don't pick 6 distinct characters that are first: (only pick 5)
- max EV is 5/6 * 2 = 5/3...
- otherwise guaranteed at least 1

else max EV is 5/3
  5/6 * 2=  5/3

1 + 5

suppose optimal solution needs multiple As. then input looks like:
- need at least 4/6 chance to roll again


is there ever a case where 1<k<6 of a letter L is an optimal solution but 6 Ls isn't?


ab

2 As 4 Bs:

4/6 * 0 + 2/6*4/6*2 = 4/9
6 As = 1


ba 

3 As 


next question: is there a case where optimal solutions that contain only a single letter L appearing more than once aren't equivalent to having that letter L appear 6x

A A B C D E

ab
ac
ba
bc
ca
cb

duplicated letter should be first? probably?

w {a,x,y,z}
x {a,w,y,z}
y {a,w,x,z}
z {a,w,x,y}

optimal: aawxyz? no

aawxyz --> 2/6 * 0 + 4/6*5/6 * 2 = 1.1111
wwxxyz --> (4/6*4/6 + 2/6*5/6)*2 = 1.4444

suppose aawxyz is optimal. can EV be more than 1?
