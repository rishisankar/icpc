Bread First Search:

- Figure out distance from root, anything that appears earlier than something with smaller distance must have bread



0 1 


multiple things have bread in same



Valid sequence if 000 111 222… ? No


For each node, assign a “priority” (i.e. order in which it is visited by parent)
	- this can be computed by looking at index of each child?

Validate sequence: simulate the BFS (accounting for any bread already existing), each time you expand a node sort the expanded nodes by their position in the original sequence (also sort bread nodes if multiple)
- If new sequence matches original, valid
- Otherwise, need to add bread
	- Run node by node comparison of original and simulated sequence
	- If a node appears earlier than it should it is a problem
		- previous nodes were plausibly visited in that order ==> this node must have bread?
