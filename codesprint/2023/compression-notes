dp[i] Cases:

1) you have at least one letter without compression: dp[i-1] + p
2) the string is compressed into X things (1<=X<=9)
  each digit processed independently (assuming no carry)
  min over X 1..9:
    X*P + sum over each digit D {dp2[D][X]}


dp2[i][j]: smallest cost to compress digit i into at most j compressions (ignoring cost of P)
  dp2[i][j]
