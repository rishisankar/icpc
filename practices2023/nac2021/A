at most 18 bits can be set in an number


consider all numbers that aren't subsets of other numbers


1 3 4 6
3 4 7
4 6 9 10

say u choose  9 10
- then u gotta kill everything that is superset of 9 10 next

consider all max stuff that contains 9 10
 1 3 9 10
 2 3 9 10 15
     9 10 15 17
     9 10 12


1346 gotta go w 7

greedy: u should always match a non subset, with something that maximizes
- how many nonsubsets are there at any time? at most 60
